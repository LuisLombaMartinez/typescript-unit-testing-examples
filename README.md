## Password checker
This repository contains a Test Driven Development (TDD) exercise based on a password checker. The requirements for the password checker are as follows:

- Length must be over 8 chars
- It must contain one uppercase letter
- It must contain one lowercase letter
- It must contain a special character

The password checker also returns the reason why a password isn't valid.

Once the exercise is completed, imagine there is a new requirement and you have to add a check password for admins that requires the use of numbers. With the approach we complete the first assignment, we can see it is very easy to add this requirement, while keeping all our tests and functionality.
